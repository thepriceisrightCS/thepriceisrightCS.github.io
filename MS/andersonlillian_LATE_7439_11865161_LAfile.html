        <p>Computers are amazing!
            We use 'em every day.
            They're packed with apps like puzzles, maps,
            And lots of awesome games to play!
            A coder is the one who makes
            The apps that we download,
            And it's done by typing lines and lines
            Of sweet computer code!
            The code's a special language
            With words and symbols too
            For talking to computers
            And telling them just what to do,
            Like show a flying T-Rex
            Or a singing purple toad.
            That dancing bear is only there
            'Cause someone wrote the code!
            Now some folks call a coder
            A software engineer,
            And a programmer is one more name
            For someone in the same career.
            A coder might make turtles race
            Or asteroids explode.
            It's tons of fun when you're the one
            Who gets to write the code!
