    <p> <h4>Definition</h4> The propulsion of the body through water by a combined motions of the arms and legs, as well as the natural floatation of the body.
 Swimming is an activity done for enjoyment or for physical contests known as sports. Swimming is a popular exercise used as an all around body-developer and useful physical therapy method. 
 It is also used for lifesaving purposes. Swimming is mainly practiced as a competitive sport and one of the most popular sports to watch in the worldwide Olympic Games. </p> 
 
 <p> <h4>History</h4>Swimming has been thought to have been practiced since 2500 BCE in Egyptian, Roman, Greek, and Assyrian civilizations. In Greek and Roman cultures, swimming was part of martial training and even a part of elementary education for males.
Eastern Asian regions have swimming dating back to 1st century BCE. There was even evidence of early racing in Japan. By the 17th century, swimming was widely required to be taught in schools. Greeks cultures held occasional competitions, and even famous athletes competed as part of training. 
By the 19th century swimming began to officially become a sport. The first swimming organization was formed in 1837. The first swimming championship was held in Australia in 1846. Not long after in 1869, the Metropolitan Swimming Clubs of London, became the Ametuaer Swimming Association. 
National swimming organizations were formed in multiple European countries from 1882 to 1889. In the US, swimming was first nationally organized as a sport by the Amatuer Athletic Union in 1888. </p> 

<p> <h4>Competitive Swimming</h4>Competitive swimming first came into fame with its inclusion in the Olympic Games in 1986. Olympic events were originally only for men, but women events were included starting in 1912. Before many of the national swimming organizations, the swimming events were held in the Seine River in France with a 200 meter obstacle race. 
This was eliminated after FINA (World Aquatics) took charge. FINA changed race lengths to be measured in meters, all world records for yard measured races were abolished in 1969. The strokes were reduced to four, which are still used today. Backstroke, butterfly, breaststroke, and freestyle. All four strokes were used in individual medley races. </p> 

<p> <h3>Strokes</h3>
    <li>
        Breaststroke: The oldest of the four strokes which is widely used for both lifesaving measures, recreational and competitive swimming. The stroke is especially effective in rough waters. It is the hardest of the four strokes to learn. The stroke is described as having a wide pull of the arms, combined with symmetrical action of the legs, simulating the movement of a frog swimming. The stroke is performed lying face down in the water while the arms are remaining submerged. There is a momentary glide at the completion of the frog kick, but athletes can choose whether or not to include this. A breath is taken at the ending of each arm pull. 
    </li>
        
    <li>
        Butterfly: The butterfly stroke is typically only used in training and competitions. It is arguably the most difficult of the strokes to do. In butterfly, the arms are brought forward above the water. The stroke originally used a frog kick similar to breaststroke, but was abandoned for a dolphin kick. Athletes use two dolphin kicks to one arm pull. Breathing is executed by raising the head every two or three strokes. 
    </li>    
     
    <li>    
        Backstroke: The swimmer's body position is lying on their back, looking upwards, laying as flat and straight as possible. The arm's reach alternately above the head and enter the water directly in line with the shoulders. The swimmer's palm is outward, with the pinky finger entering the water first. The arm is pulled back to the thigh and there is a slight body roll side to side. The kick is an up and down movement. It is the second fastest of the strokes competed. 
    </li>   
       
    <li>
    Freestyle: The fastest of all four strokes. It is also the choice of stroke for covering any considerable distance. Freestyle is also known as the crawl. In the crawl, the body lies face down on the surface of the water, with the legs slightly submerged. The arms move alternatively, timed so that one will start pulling when the other has finished the pull, making propulsion continuous. Breathing is done by turning the head to either side during recovery of the arm from that side. </p> 
    </li>   

    </p>

<p>Races: In twenty-five meter pools, the race distances consist of 25, 50, 100, 200, 400, 500, 800, 1000, 1500, 1650 meters. In the fifty meter pools the race distances are 50, 100, 200, 400, 800, and 1500 meters. The four competitive strokes are only raced in distances of 50, 100 and 200 meters. An individual medley, which is a combination of all the four strokes, can be raced in distances of 100 (twenty-five meter only), 200, and 400 meters. Relays can be raced in freestyle as well as medley. The relays can be distances of 4x100 freestyle, 4x200 freestyle, and 4x200 medley.</p> 

<p> <h3>Equipment</h3> 
<li>
    Goggles: Swim goggles help you see the pace clock, whether the large, sweeping hand of the analog clock on the wall at the pool or the splits and pace on your swim watch.Goggles help you to time your turns, touch on a full stroke, protect your eyes from pool chemicals, reduce eye strain when swimming outdoors, and help you avoid swimming full-steam into other swimmers in your lane.
 </li>
   
 <li>
    Kickboard: Kickboards isolate the legs and lower body to improve kicking strength and endurance.By gripping the board, swimmers learn to fully engage the quads, hips, core, and feet to generate propulsion with the lower body.Spending more time on the kickboard helps swimmers develop the leg endurance required to execute a more efficient stroke, finish races with a full kick, and is a great tool for breaking up longer swimming sets and workouts.</p> 
</li>
  
    <li>
    Fins: Swim fins, also known as fins or flippers, are a type of swimming gear worn on the feet that increase propulsion, strengthen the legs, improve ankle flexibility, encourage better body position, and improve kicking technique.
</li>
  
    <li>
    Snorkel:Swim snorkels enable swimmers to keep their face down in the water, promoting a better body position. This helps swimmers achieve a more hydrodynamic body line in the water. Using a swim snorkel is a great option for swimmers who train long courses as it gives extended opportunities to develop proper stroke rhythm.
</li>
    
<li>
    Paddles: Swim paddles, also known as hand training paddles, are a form of swimming equipment designed to enhance pulling strength and endurance. The standard swim paddle extends the handâ€™s surface area, helping swimmers get a better sense of how to catch the water and position the hands and fingers for maximum propulsion.
</li>   
   
<li>
    Pull Buoy: Pull buoys are one of the classic swim training aids designed to help swimmers focus on the pull and upper body. Pull buoys are a type of floatation device, specifically curved and shaped to fit between the legs or ankles, giving swimmers added buoyancy.
</li>
    
<li>
    Tempo Trainer:The device clips onto your swim goggle strap and emits a rhythmic beep or chirp at your desired cadence or tempo, helping swimmers maintain a consistent stroke rate in the water.This can help swimmers prepare for competitive situations by teaching appropriate speed and pacing, fixing excess hitches or gallops in the stroke, and even teaching a more rhythmic breathing pattern.</p>
