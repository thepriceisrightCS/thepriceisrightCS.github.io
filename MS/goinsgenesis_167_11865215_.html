        <li\[Katy Perry - Verse 1]
        I know a place
        Where the grass is really greener
        Warm, wet and wild
        There must be somethin' in the water
        Sippin' gin and juice
        Layin' underneath the palm trees (Undone)
        The boys
        Break their necks
        Try'na creep a little sneak peek (At us)
        
        You could travel the world
        But nothing comes close
        To the Golden Coast
        Once you party with us
        You'll be falling in love
        Oooooh oh oooooh
        
        [Katy Perry - Chorus]
        California girls
        We're unforgettable
        Daisy Dukes
        Bikinis on top
        Sun-kissed skin
        So hot
        We'll melt your Popsicle
        Oooooh oh oooooh
        
        California girls

        Now put your hands up
        Oooooh oh oooooh

        Sex on the beach
        We don't mind sand in our Stilettos
        We freak
        In my Jeep
        Snoop Doggy Dogg on the stereo (Oh oh)
        
        You could travel the world
        But nothing comes close
        To the Golden Coast
        Once you party with us
        You'll be falling in love

        The girl's a freak
        She drives a Jeep
        and lives on the beach
